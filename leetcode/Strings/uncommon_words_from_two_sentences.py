''' PROBLEM - Uncommon Words from Two Sentences
A sentence is a string of single-space separated words where each word consists only of lowercase letters.

A word is uncommon if it appears exactly once in one of the sentences, and does not appear in the other sentence.

Given two sentences s1 and s2, return a list of all the uncommon words. You may return the answer in any order.

        words_s1 = s1.split()
        words_s2 = s2.split()
        all_words = words_s1 + words_s2
        word_count = {}
        for word in all_words:
            word_count[word] = word_count.get(word, 0) + 1
            
        return [word for word in word_count if word_count[word] == 1]
