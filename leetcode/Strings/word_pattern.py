''' PROBLEM - Word Pattern
Given a pattern and a string s, find if s follows the same pattern.

Here follow means a full match, such that there is a bijection between a letter in pattern and a non-empty word in s. Specifically:

Each letter in pattern maps to exactly one unique word in s.
Each unique word in s maps to exactly one letter in pattern.
No two letters map to the same word, and no two words map to the same letter.
