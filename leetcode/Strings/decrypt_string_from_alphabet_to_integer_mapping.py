''' PROBLEM - Decrypt String from Alphabet to Integer Mapping
You are given a string s formed by digits and '#'. We want to map s to English lowercase characters as follows:

Characters ('a' to 'i') are represented by ('1' to '9') respectively.
Characters ('j' to 'z') are represented by ('10#' to '26#') respectively.
Return the string formed after mapping.

The test cases are generated so that a unique mapping will always exist.

    def freqAlphabets(self, s: str) -> str:
        res = []
        i = len(s) - 1
        
        while i >= 0:
            if s[i] == '#':
                num = int(s[i-2:i])
                res.append(chr(num + 96))
                i -= 3  
            else:
                num = int(s[i])
                res.append(chr(num + 96))
                i -= 1  
        
        return "".join(res[::-1])
