''' PROBLEM - 1217. Minimum Cost to Move Chips to The Same Position
We have n chips, where the position of the ith chip is position[i].

We need to move all the chips to the same position. In one step, we can change the position of the ith chip from position[i] to:

position[i] + 2 or position[i] - 2 with cost = 0.
position[i] + 1 or position[i] - 1 with cost = 1.
Return the minimum cost needed to move all the chips to the same position.

class Solution:
    def minCostToMoveChips(self, position: list[int]) -> int:
        even = 0
        odd = 0
        for i in position:
            if i % 2 == 0:
                even += 1
            else:
                odd += 1
        if even < odd:
            return even
        else:
            return odd
